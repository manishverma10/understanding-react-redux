This program is beginner level to understand how redux work and how it is used.

About Redux:
Redux is a popular JavaScript library for managing the state of your application

Redux has 3 main parts:
1. Actions: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe WHAT happened, but don’t describe HOW the app state changes.
2. Reducers: Reducers are pure functions that define HOW the app state changes. In other words, they are used to recalculate the new application state or, at least a part of it.
3. Store: the store hold the state of the application.
The store is actually an object, not a class, although it may feel like one at first. It contains a few extra things other than your application’s state as well (like functions and other objects).


To run this project it is must to have node.js latest version and react js, if you don't have then you can get that from their official site.
